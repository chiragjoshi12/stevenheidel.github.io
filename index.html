            <p>
                I develop <span class="b">software</span> and develop <span class="b">people</span>.

                In the past I've helped build quantum computers, created new professional social networking apps,
                and co-founded a startup in the entertainment space.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm quite fond of <span class="b">functional programming</span> and have written several articles on the
                topic. I've done open source work in Python and Scala, two great programming languages.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of work I like reading, going on walks with interesting people, lifting things (and then
                putting them right back down again), and an obscure Canadian winter sport.

            <p>Here are a few good books that I've read recently and would recommend to others:</p>
            <ul class="list pl0">
                <li class="mt3">
                    <span class="i">The Man Who Knew Infinity</span> by Robert Kanigel.
                    The story of the mathematics genius Ramanujan describing his life and his relationship with Hardy
                    amongst the context of British India and pre-WWI Britain.
                </li>
                <li class="mt3">
                    <span class="i">The Underground Railroad</span> by Colson Whitehead.
                    Winner of the Pulitzer Prize, this fictional novel tells the story of a young slave who learns about
                    the underground railroad - which in this world is a real network of tracks and tunnels beneath
                    the southern United States.
                </li>
                <li class="mt3">
                    <span class="i">A Random Walk Down Wall Street</span> by Burton Malkiel.
                    This is the best investing book I've read, written by the now Chief Investment Officer for
                    Wealthfront.
                </li>
                <li class="mt3">
                    <span class="i">Quantum Computing for Computer Scientists</span> by Yanofsky and Mannucci.
                    The first book on quantum computing I read, this is still the best option for a gentle introduction
                    for those who come from a computer science background rather than a physics background.
