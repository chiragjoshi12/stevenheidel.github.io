          RPCQ is an RPC framework on top of ZeroMQ which is optimized for
          performant hybrid quantum programming. I was the primary author of
          the schema and client/server specification.

      <p>
        Here are a few good books I've read that I would recommend to others:
      </p>
      <ul class="list pl0">
        <li class="mt3">
          <span class="i">Cloud Atlas</span> by David Mitchell. A fantastic
          work of fiction weaving together six different storylines into a
          single narrative. David Mitchell is my favorite author; also recommend
          <span class="i">The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet</span> and
          <span class="i">Ghostwritten</span>.
        </li>
        <li class="mt3">
          <span class="i">Digital Minimalism</span> by Cal Newport.
          This is as close to a "life-changing" book as I've ever encountered. It
          talks about the harms of device overuse on our ability to focus, and
          includes a guide on how to live more intentionally with less technology.
        </li>
        <li class="mt3">
          <span class="i">Gödel Escher Bach</span> by Douglas Hofstadter.
          A fun read with some puzzles sprinkled in, it also convinced me that
          intelligent systems can be built from many simple components.
          (eg. neurons in the brain)
        </li>
        <li class="mt3">
          <span class="i">The Man Who Knew Infinity</span> by Robert Kanigel.
          A fascinating read about mathematics genius Ramanujan describing his life
          and his relationship with Hardy amongst the context of British India
          and pre-WWI Britain.
        </li>
        <li class="mt3">
          <span class="i">A Random Walk Down Wall Street</span> by Burton
          Malkiel. This is the best investing book I've read, written by the
          now Chief Investment Officer for Wealthfront.
        </li>
        <li class="mt3">
          <span class="i">Quantum Computing for Computer Scientists</span> by
          Yanofsky and Mannucci. The first book on quantum computing I read,
          this is still the best option for a gentle introduction for those
          who come from a computer science background rather than a physics
          background.
